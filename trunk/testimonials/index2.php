      <p>A few words about James Javier, and how he touch my life &amp; my heart...<br />
   I met Jay about a year ago, at the Orland Park "Apple" store.   He would now become my "one to one" personal trainer. 
I was brand new at the computer, having studied only about a month there, with various trainers.     
I have an art background, and I really wanted to create my web-site, to showcase my work as an artist.  (Jay-to-the rescue.)
Jay really encouraged me with many suggestions &amp; ideas for me to work with...   I never worked so hard, photographing my work, writing text, editing, etc. I think Jay was quite impressed, as he too is a fantastically talented &amp; creative person.
Our minds worked so well together. We were right on track sharing thoughts &amp; ideas with one another... Oh, What a pleasure!
I truly miss James.  He means so much to me.   Never a day goes by without my thoughts &amp; prayers for his recovery.
I shall have wonderful thoughts of him for the rest of my life, and possibly beyond. He touched my life-my heart. To see some of his work, visit my web-site: <a href="http://www.pjnicholls.net" target="_blank">www.pjnicholls.net</a>. Thanks for letting me share these words with you.                                                                                                                                           </p>
