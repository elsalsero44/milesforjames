      <h1>Miles for James </h1>
	    <p><strong>Miles for James </strong>was originally established as a blog page to serve as an avenue for anyone looking to get healthy, stay motivated, and connect with James&rsquo;s friends and family.  James, for whom the site is named, suffered a traumatic brain injury as a result of being struck by a car while jogging on September 19, 2009.  Since that day, James has fought his way from an unconscious-comatose-state to his present minimally-conscious-state.  In the past four months, James has been at numerous medical care facilities, including:  Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, RML Specialty Hospital in Hinsdale, Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, Manor Care in Naperville, and Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago.</p>
	    <p><br>
        James has always been a giver.  While he openly denied and secretly loved the spotlight, his love of it was not self-serving.  For James, it was his special way of bringing laughter and joy into the lives of others.  In any of James&rsquo;s pursuits, be it writing, performing, teaching, or training, James approached every endeavor with a superhero-like confidence.  Like the Man of Steel, James dedicated his life to encouraging others to find their own super-hero strength.  This confidence and determination remains true as he makes his journey back to his family and friends.  True to James, he is not only fighting for himself, but for the many people who are waiting for him.</p>
	    <p><br>

	      Initial proceeds collected at this time will go directly towards James&rsquo;s medical expenses. As our intent moving forward is to obtain a 501c(3) status, proceeds collected post-recovery will be donated to organizations that specialize in the care, treatment, and research associated with Traumatic Brain Injuries.</div>
